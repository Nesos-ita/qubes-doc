Guidelines for Documentation Contributors
=========================================

 * Use spaces instead of tabs.
 * Hard wrap Markdown lines at 80 characters.
 * Hard wrap Git commit message lines at 72 characters.
   * This leaves exactly four spaces on each side of the commit message when
   viewed in the default `git log` format.)
 * If appropriate, make numerals in numbered lists match between Markdown source
   and HTML output.
   * In the event that a user is required to read the Markdown
   source directly, this will make it easier to follow, e.g., numbered steps in
   a set of instructions.
 * Use hanging indentations
   where appropriate.
 * Use `[reference-style][ref]` links.
