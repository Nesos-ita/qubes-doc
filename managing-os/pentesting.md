**Legal notice:**

The usage of penetration testing tools outside your own laboratory environment requires the permission of the organization you attack. Penetration testing without such a permission can have legal consequences.

To avoid such legal conflicts please refer to the [Code of Ethics](https://www.eccouncil.org/Support/code-of-ethics).
