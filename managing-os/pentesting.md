**Legal notice:**

The usage of penetration testing tools outside your own laboratory environment requires the permission of the organization you attack. Penetration testing without such a permission can have legal consequences.

To avoid such legal conflicts please refer to the [EC-Council: Code of Ethics](https://www.eccouncil.org/Support/code-of-ethics).

"A penetration test, informally pen test, is an attack on a computer system that looks for security weaknesses, potentially gaining access to the computer's features and data." (source [Penetration test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test)).

Using Qubes OS to host a "hacking" laboratory

Qubes OS is a hypervisor based operating system. Qubes OS can host various operating systems such as Linux, Unix or Windows and run them parallel. Qubes OS can therefor be used to host your own "hacking" laboratory.
