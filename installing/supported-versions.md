Supported Versions
==================

Qubes OS
--------
Qubes OS releases are supported for **six months** after each subsequent major
or minor release (see [Version Scheme]). The current release and past major
releases are always available on the [Downloads] page, while all ISOs, including
past minor releases, are available from our [FTP server].

| Qubes OS Version | Start Date | End Date   | Status                      |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| Release 1        | 2012-09-03 | 2015-03-26 | Old, unsupported            |
| Release 2        | 2014-09-26 | 2016-04-01 | Old, unsupported            |
| Release 3.0      | 2015-10-01 | 2016-09-09 | Old, unsupported            |
| Release 3.1      | 2016-03-09 | 2017-03-29 | Old, supported              |
| Release 3.2      | 2016-09-29 | TBA        | Current, supported          |
| Release 4.0      | TBA        | TBA        | In development              |


Dom0
----
The table below shows the OS used for dom0 in each Qubes OS release.

| Qubes OS Version | Dom0 OS   |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| Release 1        | Fedora 13 |
| Release 2        | Fedora 18 |
| Release 3.0      | Fedora 20 |
| Release 3.1      | Fedora 20 |
| Release 3.2      | Fedora 23 |
| Release 4.0      | TBA       |

**Note:** Dom0 is isolated from domUs. DomUs can access only a few interfaces,
such as Xen, device backends (in the dom0 kernel and in other VMs, such as the
NetVM), and Qubes tools (gui-daemon, qrexec-daemon, etc.). These components are
[security-critical], and we provide updates for all of them (when necessary),
regardless of the support status of the base distribution. For this reason, we
consider it safe to continue using a given base distribution in dom0 even after
it has reached end-of-life.

TemplateVMs
-----------
The table below shows the [TemplateVM] versions supported by each Qubes OS
release. Currently, only Fedora and Debian TemplateVMs are officially supported.

| Qubes OS Version | Fedora Versions | Debian Versions                               |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Release 1        | 18, 20          | None                                          |
| Release 2        | 21              | None                                          |
| Release 3.0      | 21, 22\*, 23    | 7 ("wheezy")\*, 8 ("jessie")                  |
| Release 3.1      | 21, 22\*, 23    | 7 ("wheezy")\*, 8 ("jessie"), 9 ("stretch")\* |
| Release 3.2      | 23, 24\*        | 8 ("jessie"), 9 ("stretch")\*                 |
| Release 4.0      | TBA             | TBA                                           |
